        <h3>Understanding Blood Pressure</h3>
        <p>Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against artery walls. Normal blood pressure is typically below 120/80 mmHg. High blood pressure (hypertension) affects nearly half of American adults.</p>
        
        <h3>Natural Management Strategies</h3>
        <p><strong>1. Dietary Changes:</strong> Reduce sodium intake to less than 2,300mg daily. Increase potassium-rich foods like bananas, spinach, and avocados. Follow the DASH diet pattern.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2. Regular Exercise:</strong> Aim for 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity weekly. Walking, swimming, and cycling are excellent choices.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3. Stress Management:</strong> Practice deep breathing, meditation, or yoga. Chronic stress can elevate blood pressure significantly.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4. Weight Management:</strong> Even losing 5-10 pounds can make a meaningful difference in blood pressure readings.</p>
        
        <p><em>Important: Always consult your healthcare provider before making changes to blood pressure medications.</em></p>

        <h3>Common Early Warning Signs</h3>
        <p><strong>Increased Thirst and Urination:</strong> When blood sugar is high, kidneys work overtime to filter excess glucose, leading to frequent urination and dehydration.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Unexplained Weight Loss:</strong> Despite eating normally, you may lose weight as your body breaks down muscle and fat for energy.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Fatigue:</strong> High blood sugar prevents glucose from entering cells effectively, leaving you feeling tired and weak.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Blurred Vision:</strong> High blood sugar can cause the lens of your eye to swell, affecting vision.</p>
        
        <h3>When to See a Doctor</h3>
        <p>If you experience multiple symptoms, especially if you have risk factors like family history, obesity, or are over 45, schedule a screening test immediately.</p>
        
        <p>Early diagnosis allows for better management and can prevent serious complications like heart disease, kidney damage, and nerve problems.</p>

        <h3>The Mind-Body Connection</h3>
        <p>Research shows that mental and physical health are deeply interconnected. Poor mental health can lead to physical symptoms, and chronic physical conditions can affect mental well-being.</p>
        
        <h3>How Mental Health Affects Physical Health</h3>
        <p><strong>Immune System:</strong> Chronic stress and depression can weaken immune function, making you more susceptible to infections.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Heart Health:</strong> Anxiety and depression increase risk of heart disease by affecting blood pressure and heart rhythm.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Sleep Patterns:</strong> Mental health conditions often disrupt sleep, which impacts physical recovery and cognitive function.</p>
        
        <h3>Building Mental Resilience</h3>
        <p>Regular exercise, social connections, adequate sleep, and stress management techniques can improve both mental and physical health simultaneously.</p>
        
        <p>Consider professional help if you're experiencing persistent sadness, anxiety, or other mental health concerns.</p>

        <h3>Types of Cholesterol</h3>
        <p><strong>LDL (Bad) Cholesterol:</strong> Low-density lipoprotein carries cholesterol to arteries where it can build up as plaque. Target: Less than 100 mg/dL.</p>
        
        <p><strong>HDL (Good) Cholesterol:</strong> High-density lipoprotein removes cholesterol from arteries. Target: 40 mg/dL or higher for men, 50 mg/dL for women.</p>
        
        <h3>Management Strategies</h3>
        <p><strong>Diet:</strong> Reduce saturated fats, eliminate trans fats, increase fiber intake. Mediterranean diet patterns are particularly effective.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Regular physical activity can raise HDL and lower LDL cholesterol levels.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Medications:</strong> Statins and other medications may be necessary for some individuals to reach target levels.</p>

        <p><strong>Quarter plate:</strong> Lean protein (chicken, fish, tofu)</p>
        <p><strong>Quarter plate:</strong> Starchy foods (brown rice, quinoa, sweet potato)</p>
        
        <h3>Helpful Foods</h3>
        <p><strong>Fiber-rich foods:</strong> Help slow sugar absorption and improve blood glucose control.</p>
        <p><strong>Healthy fats:</strong> Avocados, nuts, olive oil support heart health.</p>
        
        <h3>Meal Timing</h3>
